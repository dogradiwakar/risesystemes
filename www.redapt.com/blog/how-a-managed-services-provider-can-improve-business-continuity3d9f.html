          <span><p><a href="https://content.redapt.com/finding-the-right-msp-for-your-business" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Managed services providers (MSPs)</a> offer large and small companies alike cost-effective access to new technologies, due to economies of scale and their ability to keep up to date with best practices.</p>
<p>Companies typically take on an MSP that can handle the technology needs, from cloud deployment to introducing best practices for scalability and performance.</p>

<p><strong>Seeking a managed services provider to set up, deploy, and troubleshoot applications not only saves time, but it also improves your organization's business continuity.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>How MSP partners improve business continuity</strong></h2>
<p>For many businesses, the biggest, single improvement to note is being able to move from <a href="difference-between-managed-services-and-staff-augmentation.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dependence on a few internal technology people</a> to a team of professionals. A small internal technology team may handle cloud deployment and a range of other duties in-house, whereas a team of individuals are able to spend their time understanding and applying best practices to support performance and operations.</p>
<p>While there may be a single point of contact at the MSP, there’s a team of qualified people behind them ready to jump in and help out. This ensures anytime availability that's far superior to reliance on a few individuals.</p>

<p>MSPs streamline cloud and app deployment. Because of this, many companies see an uptick in availability and performance, with 24/7 availability always the goal. Others notice improvements in data recovery and backups, which are key to ensuring business continuity.</p>
<p>Since MSPs work with clients one-on-one, the specific benefits correlate strongly to the organization's weak points. In other words, those back-burner items your IT person never gets to will be resolved, freeing up in-house time and resources to focus on mission critical duties and innovation.</p>
<p>Taken together, these benefits ensure you’re able to focus on implementing systems to prevent or deter threats, safeguard critical assets, and restore critical operations and valuable data after a threat or interruption.</p>
<h2><strong>Additional benefits of MSPs</strong></h2>
<p>Many companies move to an MSP approach to gain access to specialized, expensive engineering skill sets they don't have in-house and don't need on a full-time basis.</p>

<p>These include skills like big data, database, or network engineering. Outsourcing these skills as part of an MSP approach is far more cost-effective than hiring in-house due to economies of scale.</p>
<p><strong>Managed services providers are able to do a lot more in less time.</strong> If you've been hoping to add a new service, such as VPN or Remote Desktop, they can set up and deploy it quickly, so your organization enjoys a smooth service rollout.</p>
<p>Plus, security risks may become all but non-existent. Information security scanning and reporting protects your resources using best-in-class practices to reduce risk. MSP partners take control of backup, security, and data recovery using best practices for encryption, security, backups, and storage.</p>
<p>By scaling and sizing smartly, <strong>managed services providers can reduce your costs while implementing needed services quickly and effectively.</strong></p>
