          <span><p>A tech-savvy CIO of a well-established dot com recognized a common business problem: competitors coming into the market were able to develop and deploy features for their customers at a much faster rate than they could.</p>

<p>Fueling this speed gap between the company and its competitors was technical debt— applications and development technologies that had been cutting-edge 10 years before, but were now leading to major inefficiencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Knowing the company needed to make a major change, the CIO approached Redapt looking for a solution that would greatly improve the company’s efficiency without causing disruption for its customers.</p>

<h2><strong>Working backwards from the desired outcome</strong></h2>
<p>With the endgame of increased efficiency and no downtime in mind, Redapt partnered with the company to thoroughly examine its current development process. What we found was a monolithic architecture—including waterfall development methodologies—that greatly slowed down the company’s process.</p>
<p>Through workshops and in-depth discussions, we came to the conclusion that containers would allow them to move towards a DevOps culture. This would enable them to iterate on their software and deploy several times a day. And, since the company worked with very large sets of data already on their premises, they also needed to have a technology stack and hardware to match the workload's performance requirements.</p>
<p>Another major aspect of the project was the company’s desire to move to a platform that would help them achieve efficiency with CICD automation, along with a desire to deploy infrastructure capacity at rack scale. So, Redapt worked with them on an initial architecture incorporating rack design—including a software stack—that could be made ready at Redapt’s facilities and immediately turned on at the company’s data center.</p>
<h2><strong>The acceleration to remain competitive</strong></h2>
<p>In the end, Redapt’s work helped the dot com essentially provide a cloud-like service capacity to developers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By adopting DevOps culture and processes, they were able to greatly accelerate their ability to develop and deploy software in a scalable, reliable, and secure fashion. They were also able to roll back just as quickly if a problem occurred so their customers wouldn’t be affected.</p>
<p>Gone were the monolithic architecture and technical debt. And the company—which has been around for more than a decade—is now back in the driver’s seat when it comes to innovation and serving its customers.</p>
