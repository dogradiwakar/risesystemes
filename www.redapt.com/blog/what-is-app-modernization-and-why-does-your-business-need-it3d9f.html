          <span><p>It seems like every week there are new buzzwords and phrases around business IT that make it hard to know what's valuable to your business. App modernization is one that’s easily lost in the fray, but it’s actually a crucial process that can greatly benefit your business.</p>
<p>Let’s unpack exactly what it is, how to do it, and look at ways it can be applied to your company.</p>

<h2>Defining App Modernization</h2>
<p>Software and apps are critical to your infrastructure, and migrating to the cloud or a new solution can be terrifying – if not debilitating – for your company.</p>
<p>So, what do you do? Do you accept the dangers of undergoing the difficult process of migrating your business over to new software and invest in training for all your employees, or do you risk applications becoming obsolete? Thankfully, there’s another way.</p>
<p><strong>Application modernization (or app modernization) is a term used for the process of enhancing existing systems to meet evolving business needs.</strong> Instead of throwing out the systems you’ve used every day, you can leverage their foundation and better suit them to your needs and the needs of a modern business.</p>
<p>You’re able to pull out all the good parts – the functions that continue to work well and are crucial to your business – and improve upon the factors of your systems that are holding you back. Oftentimes this will also relate to compatibility with other software. If you’re using outdated systems, you’ll find that new programs won’t talk with it well or even at all. In an era where seamless interaction and processes are more sought after than ever, app modernization can be the answer you’ve been looking for.</p>
<h2>Going Through the Modernization Process</h2>
<p>Modernization involves essentially re-coding large parts of the software itself. Sometimes this can even mean <a href="http://searchcloudapplications.techtarget.com/news/4500247423/Legacy-application-modernization-takes-careful-thought">converting the language of the software</a>, like going from Java to C#. But before you can even get to that part, there are a few crucial steps that will better guide you and make sure you’re not wasting time on the wrong software.</p>
<p>You first want to audit your entire app portfolio to see where needs are being met and where they can improve. Redapt makes a point to guide you through this process, helping you decide what apps are the best candidates for modernization and what will make most sense for your business.</p>
<p>Then, once you have some options, we’ll want to consider what’s the best route to make your app more efficient. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there an opportunity to simplify it for ease of use?</li>
<li>Are there more features that can be added?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
We’ll work alongside you to figure out what you need most and find the best path to making it happen. Modernization can be a lengthy process, so we suggest starting small for your first app and tackling on bigger software the next time around.<br>
<h2>So, Should You Invest in App Modernization?</h2>
<p>Technology changes fast, so keeping your systems up-to-date is essential. And, as <a href="https://threatpost.com/outdated-unpatched-software-rampant-in-businesses/117976/">Threat Post points out</a>, many businesses are not using current software or have not performed updates which leaves them vulnerable and behind their competitors.</p>
<p>App modernization alleviates these issues that can plague your business, offering an alternative to uprooting your current systems and starting over. Not all apps are great candidates for modernization, but chances are there are a few in your business that can benefit from a digital makeover.</p>
<p>Looking for guidance on how to modernize your outdated systems? Or maybe you’re unsure where the opportunities to enhance your systems exist.
