<h3>Video transcription:</h3>
<p>Hi, everyone. Thank you for joining today's webinar on <em>Modernizing Your Applications for the Cloud</em> with Redapt. Redapt is a technology solutions provider focused on helping our customers navigate the ever-changing and complex landscape of enterprise technology. At Redapt, we believe that highly successful organizations are those who adopt highly successful technologies.</p>
<p>Today, we have an exciting webinar about modernizing your applications for the cloud, with our app mod expert and Practice Area Director, Rakesh Anantharaman.</p>
<p>As you have questions, feel free to drop them in the chat. And we'll address those at the end of the webinar. Go ahead and take it away.</p>
<p>Thanks, Sarah. I'm guessing you guys can hear me okay. So, thank you for being here. And as Sarah was just mentioning, this is going to be <em>Modernizing Your Applications for the Cloud</em>. So, just a little bit of background before we get started: I've been with Redapt for close to 10 years now, and as Sarah just mentioned, I'm the practice director for the application modernization practice. I've been doing this for a while now, close to 14, 15 years experience. I've worked all over the East Coast and I've been with Redapt for close to 10 years. We have a strong set of enterprise architects, as well as cloud engineers working on my team, and we work together to solve interesting problems that the customers have. Mostly focusing on agility and cost savings from the customers. There are multiple other KPIs that we also have, but these other things are the core things that we focused on.</p>
<p>And we also focus on end-to-end solutions, across a spectrum of what platform on the web, mobile, desktop platforms. Microsoft stack, MEAN stack. So, any kind of custom development work comes from what we do in our practice and we are pretty good at that. So, these are the four different things that we'll be covering today.</p>
<p>First one that we'll be focusing on is current enterprise challenges. One of the different challenges about facing a company's—both in the price model and business model in an immediate level, as well as other types of challenges that we are facing.</p>
<p>Second would be around what makes applications modern, right? We talk about modernizing, modernizing, but what it actually means. It doesn't mean a new UI skin that we put on, it doesn't mean containerization, doesn't mean other kinds of stuff that can happen. What does that actually mean? Because every company today, they have three or four different types of applications. They have your customer-facing applications, they have internal applications, as well as some of the B2B applications about the cloud.</p>
<p>And, of course, that is data that goes along with it, right? So, every user interaction with any kind of application, works with data, consumes, and generates a ton of data. So how does modernization fit in? Is it on the website or is it on the data site? Because every business connects tremendous amount of information.</p>
<p>And our main challenge is how to turn this data into actionable insights and intelligence, so you guys, and we can, provide that superior customer experience when somebody comes to our website, and all of that.</p>
<p>The third one that we'll be going over, is the roadmap modernize application. Every application is unique in its own spectrum. So, how can we approach it and put a roadmap together so we can modernize the applications that we have?</p>
<p>And the fourth one, the good thing that I want to talk to today about, is a case study for a company that we helped move to the cloud, and actually helping them with other features that, on an ongoing basis, that are building. And we'll be covering that in the case study.</p>
<p>All right. So, moving on to the first topic that people want to talking about, product enterprise challenges. So, the two major challenges that we hear every day when we talk to customers, when we- enterprise levels, SMB, any kind of customers that we talk to, our speed and agility.</p>
<p>Number one, how do you bring products to markets faster than modern data, because it's an ever-changing market. And the second is finding efficiencies and workflows reduce costs. As, you know, as I was talking about initially.</p>
<p>The two pillars of practices release- speed, agility, speed, agility. How do we reduce the cost? How do we make sure that our customers can get their products out to market faster than what others can provide? As well constantly update the products, listening to the customers. Absolutely. And constantly updating the products on what- using their best practices that are there.</p>
<p>The third thing under speed is working faster to free up more time for innovation. So, that kind of is very- goes into agility or speed, whatever way you want to classify that. Because we are no longer ... I think people agree we don't use waterfall methodology anymore. Right? It's always going to be how agile you are, what kind of methodologies do you use, how can we speed it up? Again, it all depends on how we can get to the market as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Just along with these two, there are a few other things that I would also like to mention. Customers, even though no matter how modern your application is, how modern they look, three things that they care about– speed. Number one is speed, as it mentions here.</p>
<p>And when I say speed, not just delivering things to the marketplace pretty quickly, but how fast is your application made? Nobody's going to return to a slow website, or a slow mobile app. I think the second one along those lines is personalization. And we focus that a lot on the app mod side as well, because customers care a lot about personalized experience. Experiences that, you know, they log into a mobile app, and they expect the mobile app, or web app, to remember who they they are. And it should be able to learn from them over time and deliver personalized experience as well. Right? So, that's important.</p>
<p>That's also something we're hearing from enterprise customers, and that could very well translate PC speed.</p>
<p>And the customer experience has to be the same across whichever device they're using. It could be a mobile phone, a tablet, the form factor should be fitted and they should not see any differences, and it would be an inconsistent experience across platforms will drive the customers away. And how do we kind of ensure agility? How do we follow the best practices? And be agile to get that product out the door is something that we hear as a challenge every day.</p>
<p>This is just a quick data point that I wanted to throw in there about modern prices, and understand the key right now. To achieve the speed and agility is through modern app modernization. And we have app modernization that's in the next few slides. And a couple of tid bits here. In a global application, Mark Atmar services is expecting to get close to 11 billion by the end of 2020. And it's expected to shoot up, I believe, over the course of the next five years. So, are these enterprise—are they ready for you? Are they ready to make the transition? So as to satisfy the customer needs is something that we are ... it's something that they are introspecting say, "Hey, are we ready?" And that's where modernizing apps really helps. Making the application more cloud native.</p>
<p>And as you guys can see, I mean, any kind of website that we talked about has evolved over the last several years. It used to be more like a standard content before. A few websites have still started content, but right now, it's more just going back to the agility and the speed concept that we were talking about.</p>
<p>The development of these web applications, these mobile apps, they have to be way more agile. Not just in term of quick updates, but also being able to provide that consistent experience across different platforms. So, that's something that I'll be saying over and over again, talking about it over the course of this webinar.</p>
<p>And this is not news. If you're not under a rock, if you have not been living under the rock in 2020, the pandemic has accelerated the need for enterprise, to modernize the application. That's what, at least, we are seeing on the Redapt side where more and more customers are interested. They are motivated and go, "Hey, let's modernize it." Not just putting a new UI layer on top of it, but what are some of the best practices that we should do to ensure that even if something like this were to happen, how can people work remotely? How can we support them remotely?</p>
<p>And so you can have the business partner would be where you are, right? I mean, you could Those are fine to me. Do we have the business continuity? Do we have the right satisfactory recovery in place? Do we have the right time availability set up in place? So, those are the things that has fast tracked the app monetization that, at least, we have seen in the past a few months after the whole pandemic happened, after the whole COVID-19 thing started happening. So, this again, this is important for the school. And we covered that.</p>
<p>All right. The other thing that we have also seen during this phase is the companies that have invested time and resources into automizing the applications already, they were doing it before, they've been able to provide greater flexibility to teams no matter where they work. Wherever they work, they have the flexibility, because the applications are hosted on a cloud platform and they can go and manage it pretty easily, right?</p>
<p>So, how do you reduce—and they have also been able to reduce costs by scaling in the cloud. As you know, cloud infinite scale. So, you can scale your applications, you can host your applications on any data center that you want. And how do you actually reduce costs just by not having a machine running below your desk, in your office, right? It's all in the cloud, easily manageable, easily updatable, easily controllable.</p>
<p>And how did they achieve this is something that's interesting, because we have seen a pattern in these enterprises that have already embraced this, which is they are familiar with DevOps practices. They are very familiar with the modernization concept. So, they have used to the best practices that have been laid out there to get modernized, to take that step into cloud, and make it more cloud native, and they've been very successful from what would they've be doing the last few months that we have seen.</p>
<p>So, that covers the first portion that we talked about. We'll move into the second one or two. Okay. We've talked a lot about modern applications. What does modernization actually mean?</p>
<p>So, these, it can be coming to us, it could be classified into four different pillars. Elasticity, resiliency, scalability, and efficiency. Right?</p>
<p>So, what does elasticity mean? So, your application should be able to run on any device on any platform. Or rather, your architecture, the application that you design, should be platform and device and cost. Right?</p>
<p>And this is when you've seen containerization helps. That's a very long word for me to say. So, containerization helps a lot. And we've also seen that people who have embraced this technology, they get more than lasting. They can scale easily. And once you are elastic, the next few things comes pretty easily.</p>
<p>Resiliency, scale-up. It's the applications are scalable. And the efficiency piece is successful. So elasticity is the main pillar behind it.</p>
<p>Second one, of course, resiliency. And if one part of your application goes down, it should not take the rest with it, right? If a small portion of an application is unable to—nobody's able to interact with it, that doesn't mean your report suffers. if you're, if you're unable to manage your inventory, you should still be able to manage the boats and get some kind of profitability or some kind of cash flow.</p>
<p>So that is another key concept of modernizing applications.</p>
<p>Third one that people always ask, "Okay, how scalable is my application? Can you scale infinitely? Because I have customer demands. You know, on Christmas day, I would probably need 15 different virtual machines that are running, but after Christmas, I would want to go get it all the way because I don't see that much traffic." So, how does that help? You know, cloud helps you do it. As well as the other thing that's also becoming predominant is segments of the application.</p>
<p>By the way, scale only a portion of the application so that I don't have to pay for scaling the entire application. It's going to be a matter of cost savings there. So, when you think about modernizing applications, that's what you have to think about, you know.</p>
<p>How do I keep it separate enough? How do I decouple this application so it can individually scale these bits and pieces, these segments, as we would like to call it? And without having to scale the entire app and get some cost savings there? And also tell the customers?</p>
<p>The fourth one, efficiency, right? Every single application - and this goes back to the agility conversation that people are having before - applications should be written in such a way that it needs to be updated routinely. Because it has to be more agile. We have to keep updating it, especially compared to the traditional waterfall apps. Traditionally, we used to need some requirements, let's go do it, apply it, and come back later and fix it. But that's not how it works right now.</p>
<p>You have these agile methodologies when you release your production environment every few, every few weeks. So, customers are happy with what they're seeing. They're seeing progress, not necessarily one huge chunk that is applied in the field. A year, you're working on something in the field applied, rather than seeing small portion and small improvements, small features here and there, you can add using the agile methodology.</p>
<p>So just to sum it up, four main things that you would probably need to be focusing on elasticity, resiliency, scalability, and efficiency. And that kind of makes any application on the mobile app. And when you think about it, it makes the application modern.</p>
<p>So, we talked about a little bit of what makes applications modern. What does it allow? It doesn't solve a problem that we were talking about before, right?</p>
<p>Modernized applications allows enterprises to use the native cloud, those are available, rather than building from scratch. That is always the build-versus-buy conversation that happens. But by using the cloud made of tools that are already out there, by focusing on what we just covered, resiliency and efficiency, we are using what's already there in the cloud and go and use it, rather than building your own platform, building your own data center and going to it. So, that is one thing that's provided by going the cloud way.</p>
<p>Second thing would be scaling the competence of software independently for greater elasticity, because we talked about elasticity. You don't have to scale your entire application. How have you segmented the applications into smaller pieces so you only have to scale that small piece and not the entire application?</p>
<p>Third, which focuses on costs again, and scaling as well. So, the workloads that are going to be used heaviest, you would have to scale depending on the traffic that are coming in. So, enterprises will be able to do that. And just back down, what's the demand? It's the same example that it was talking before. You know, Christmas day or Thanksgiving day, I wanted to scale up the auditing platform, right? The auditing segment inside the application, because I see many customers coming in during these days, case auditors. But once that's done, I can take it up a couple of notches, because I'm not going to see the same number of requests, and the same number of customers on the boat.</p>
<p>So these are a few things that we continue modernizing applications, the four main pillars that we talked about, and what it does the enterprise customers to do.</p>
<p>The third one that we are going to cover today is an old map to modernist applications. Right? When I was talking about it initially, I said, "Every application is different. It's going to be difficult to ... it's going to put a generic application roadmap together, but we can focus on three or four different things that every application should be focusing on to start modernizing.</p>
<p>So, I'm just going through this a little bit more in detail. We have customers who are interested in simple lift and shift, right? But what we are seeing more and more every day, what our app modernization should be focusing on. It's not just simple lifts and shifts into the cloud, right? They kind of just do it lifted from an on-premise virtual machine and run it on an agile virtual machine, whatever the virtual machine is going to be running on.</p>
<p>It does get you a little bit of cost savings, but it doesn't actually mean that you have modernized your applications. Probably not, because it has not delivered the full benefits of modern platforms. It's also a few things, but I don't consider that as modernizing an application.</p>
<p>Second thing is not every application and enterprise portfolio is suitable for the cloud, right? So, have to analyze every application that's in your suite of applications and determine what makes sense to move into the cloud.</p>
<p>In a few cases, you may say, "I don't see a lot of traffic in here and it does not have to scale a lot. It's only going to be internal application. I'm just going to keep it safe." Fine. We're not going to come in and just say, "This is something that needs to be moved into the cloud," but that can be a few other updates that can be done to the application. So, for us to maintain it easily for new updates to modernize easily for the future. So, not every application in an enterprise would move to the cloud.</p>
<p>The third thing that we have to be focusing on when we do the modernization is once we identify which application needs to be cloud-architected to become more cloud native. And what we have seen is we call them legacy applications, because they are running on a virtual machine on somebody's desktop or somebody's computer. Right?</p>
<p>So, what we've seen is those need to be pulled out with the park and re-architected in such way that it actually fits well when we move the cloud native. And that's something that we are recommending that the focus should be when we think about app modernization.</p>
<p>And the fourth, this is just something about- application modernization usually means modernizing our enterprise work. And that's not actually ... just an application, you know? Yes, make sure this application is up and running, make sure it's in the cloud. Sure.</p>
<p>But one of the things that we are achieving, are we putting together the best practices funding for the customer? So any kind of future work, they can take the right steps to think about it, right, when they move to the cloud.</p>
<p>So, this is a generic list that we can think about, any aspect of which application we choose. And once we choose a specific application to be modernized, then it would change based on the application, because the architecture is going to be different. How we deliver that to the customer is going to be different.</p>
<p>Five different steps that we are suggesting any kind of app modernization to go through. Number one is catalog all your existing applications in your portfolio. This would come under more like an application rationalization kind of a framework, because we would be [catalog] everybody to catalog existing ones. We would have no idea how many customers will be available, where they may have an application that's running somewhere that nobody has used over the last couple of years, but it's still there accruing costs and it's not useful for anybody. So, take a step back, catalog all your existing applications within your suite, and make sure you capture the relevant points.</p>
<p>Once you've captured that, understand the use cases for your existing applications, right? Which is the rationalization. Think about why you would you need this application. Do you actually need it? Look at the customers, look at how many times has this application been used. Talk to folks who have used this application and understand what it actually means. Why did they use it? Would they be okay if this application goes in a broader sense? Or if that's the case, can we combine the small feature that they're using into another application so they are happy and it's not picking up speed?</p>
<p>Third one. Once you do that, identify the applications that are suitable for migration to the cloud, and that's - once you do one and two -third would become a little bit easier for you, because now you know these are the different applications. So, you have ID faded applications, you have these ones, and important, these ones need to be scaled. These ones need to be rearchitected if needed or from the cloud environments, the cloud data we'll be focusing on, and how would you rearchitect them to make it cloud native, focusing on the four points that we talked about initially.</p>
<p>First one is okay. Once you've identified the applications, once you put together the architecture, let's create a proof of concept for the application. Let's not jump into it. Let's do a crowd walk around the approach like people like to call it. Because once you have the VR, once you have architected the solution, check it out, create a proof of concept. And once it looks good here, okay, now we have a path, now we have a roadmap to actually start implementing on the architecture that you put together.</p>
<p>So, you can get, get the run portion pretty quickly. You have crawled so far with the proof of concept, you're walking, and when you actually go implement, you're actually running with the application.</p>
<p>So, five main steps for you to focus on when we talk about app modernization. What it actually means and how you can approach app optimization.</p>
<p>Okay. So, the fourth one that we wanted to cover today was a case study in today. And we'll be happy to talk about this case study, because this one is close to my heart. We've been working with Tandem Diabetes. We've been partners for the last three, three and a half years. And we've seen the company grow a lot during these three years. And we have partnered with them, helped them grow. And we have grown a lot which is fantastic.</p>
<p>So, Tandem Diabetes, they are a medical devices manufacturing company based off a base in Southern California. And what they do is they manufacture the insulin pumps. They call them smart insulin pumps. And these pumps are attached to your body so you don't have to ... whenever you have to get your blood sugar levels tested, this test is automatically for you, it's continuous glucose monitoring. So you don't have to kind of do what every day or every week.</p>
<p>It monitors your blood glucose level continuously. And if it feels that it's kind of going down, it gives you an insulin shot in a way. It's not going to wait for you to take it.</p>
<p>So, the country has glucose monitoring and insulin pumps was a pretty good idea when that was launched, and we helped them launch it out of the gate by engaging with them. So, their main problem was, as I said, they manufactured insulin pumps and the company needed a better way to engage with its customers, because it's a smart device. They have to sit with the customer to explain what it does, and all the different features that go along with it. And that was costing Tandem Diabetes a lot of ... it was costing them money as well as they couldn't use that to do other work, build other features.</p>
<p>So, we helped them build a cool customer portal to better meet the needs of the customers, where a customer can log into this portal and look at their blood glucose level. It's updated every minute or updated every hour. Which means the customer no longer has to call Tandem's customer support, "Hey, what's my blood glucose levels? Watch glucose levels," rather, you know.</p>
<p>Here it is, this is how it is. And if you're, excuse me, if your blood glucose level, if you see anything off with it, these are the things that you have to do. This is a number that you have to call, but here's the data, here's the raw data for you.</p>
<p>And when we designed this using Azure, and we developed a virtual training module as well, that educated both the customers and met the FDA requirements. And as you can imagine, this insulin pump generates a lot of data because it's constantly monitoring their blood sugar levels. So it generates a lot of data and keeps pumping it in.</p>
<p>The first thing that we had to solve for them was what data makes sense and what data does not, right? Putting on the end customer's hat. So, we used Azure's IOT edge device infrastructure here, where we are getting a lot of data pumped in from the insulin pump. We used the actual function to get the data, parse the data, massage the data, and land up into a sequel database that the customer portal can pull and get data out of them.</p>
<p>And this one helped because we didn'and we used Azure's platform as a service. We use ad services, we use containers. So, we can get the resiliency, we can get the agility, and we can get the scalability that's needed, because this is a solution that we scaled pretty quickly.</p>
<p>But the number of people who are diabetic and who need insulin pumps in the U.S. is increasing. So, this one, they help those people achieve continuous glucose monitoring, which could be life-threatening in a few cases, right? So, it wasn't a very good project for all involved.</p>
<p>And the outcome of that was they've been able to completely modernized their customer relationship, which increased Tandem's relationships, the relationships with the customers as well, because that gave them a good platform for them to go run reports based on cloud data.</p>
<p>They also provided virtual training. With Azure, we created some training videos there as well as help them achieve what was possible. So, just wanted to talk about the case study that we did with them.</p>
<p>So, to sum everything up, going through the previous 15, 16 slides, app modernization is the key to achieving speed and agility. The two main pillars that we focused on before. And how do we do it? And leveraging platforms like Azure, allows enterprises to scale applications, reduce the workload cost, goes back to resiliency, again, create resilient applications. Cut down on the costs, deploy new products for the customers faster, which is the key. I think how agile you are, are you listening to the customers? Making the changes and applying it to the end customers as fast as possible, and also reduce costs, and create that resilient, scalable applications.</p>
<p>The last slide here is how does Redapt help? Because Redapt has extensive experience with app modernization on all cloud platforms. And we are able to assist in the last piece of what we talked about, right? You know, we do app rationalization, we do app modernization, and we do proof of concept helps. We do chat-bots. We do a bunch of other things in my practice that deals with. And we do full-assistant day two operations. So, an assistant during migration, as well as day two operations of the practice that we also have, other practices that help with day two operations and migrations as well.</p>
<p>Just to sum it up over there and we are ready to get started. And the link is there, please hit us up. Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you, Rakesh. We have a few questions here for you in the Q&amp;A. First question: Will all of our existing services be available on the cloud? When you migrate, I suppose.</p>
<p>So it kind of depends on the services itself over here, because again, we'll go through the app rationalization and the app requirements. First we have to analyze what the services are.</p>
<p>It depends on a cloud-by-cloud basis. But what at least we have seen on the app, say this weekend, that we can get as much close as possible to the substance that will be able to the cloud.</p>
<p>Great. Second question: how do you weigh the remodel versus rebuild question?</p>
<p>You mean the remodel with the speed? Yeah, so it's a good question. And that's remodeling your existing application.</p>
<p>It also, again, depends on the application. Because once we go through the architecture, and keep in mind this is what is needed for a product would make the work, we would probably take a different approach. And the proof of concept helps here, because we've seen applications that is no way for us to be able to move into the cloud. Right? If you have a Windows application that's running on a Citrix server, just an example.</p>
<p>For a person to be able to move that into cloud is going to be a little bit difficult. And just as a lift and shift, because when you're doing the lift and shift, that makes sense for you to write that, or change the Windows application into the more of a web app, which is easier for you to manage and deploy. And then move it over to cloud. Right? So, in that case, it's not necessarily remodeling. You are actually rebuilding an application using the same business logic and business features that are out there. But rebuilding it so it's not Windows, it's more like a web application that's there for you.</p>
<p>That depends on the application, but once we do the analysis, once we talk to the different stakeholders involved, we will be able to make the determination on if it's a rebuild versus just remodeling, just to make it work.</p>
<p>Got it. And last question: Is it best to migrate all at once or in phases?</p>
<p>Yeah, that's a good question. I think what makes sense is just do it in phases because, you know, I was talking about the crawl, walk, run approach. It's much better to do and do it in phases because ... create a proof of concept first, make sure that works. And again, every application's need is a little bit different. But it's always better to do it in phases. So, you can know what portion works and what does not.</p>
<p>And in a few cases, it makes sense to keep them where it is. And it's always better to do it rather than take one big... take a big jump. Yeah.</p>
<p>And do you find that is more cost-effective to do things that way? Or is it more cost-effective to migrate all at once?</p>
<p>It is cost effective. I mean, on the cost effectiveness side, it is definitely better to do it in small phases. So, you understand how much cost savings that I that's happened as well as just to see how much scalability you actually need. So, it's definitely cost effective. You know, it's much more scalable if you do it that way. And we can showcase the application.</p>
